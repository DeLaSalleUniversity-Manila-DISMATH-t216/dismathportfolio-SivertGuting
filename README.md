#WEEK 1
-I was introduced to and was given a preview of what this course is about.

-I learned the basic symbols used in DISMATH.

-I learned that DISMATH is a fun course, though quite hard and challenging.

#WEEK 2
-I learned that a proposition can either be true or false.

-I learned the Logical Connectives. These are the Negation, Conjunction, Disjunction, Exclusive, Conditional and Biconditional.

-I was also introduced to the first tool in dismath, the Truth Table.

-I learned the laws of Logical Equivalence, which are the Identity Law, Domination Law, Negation Law, Double Negation Law, Idempotent Law, Commutative Law, Associative Law, Distributive Law, De Morgan's Law, and Absorption Law.

-I learned the different Rules of Inference. These are Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Hypothetical Syllogism, Disjunctive Syllogism, Addition, Simplification, Conjunction and Resolution.

#WEEK 3
I learned some methods of proof. These are the:

-Direct Proof

-Proof by Contraposition

-Vacuous Proof

-Trivial Proof

-Proof by Contradiction

-Proof by Equivalence

I also learned that 0 is even. :D


#WEEK 4
-I learned more about the Proof by Equivalence.

-I learned the proof by Mathematical Induction, which I remember from my ENGALG2 class.
