#WEEK 1
-I was introduced to and was given a preview of what this course is about.

-I learned the basic symbols used in DISMATH.

-I learned that DISMATH is a fun course, though quite hard and challenging.

#WEEK 2
-I learned that a proposition can either be true or false.

-I learned the Logical Connectives. These are the Negation, Conjunction, Disjunction, Exclusive, Conditional and Biconditional.

-I was also introduced to the first tool in dismath, the Truth Table.

-I learned the laws of Logical Equivalence, which are the Identity Law, Domination Law, Negation Law, Double Negation Law, Idempotent Law, Commutative Law, Associative Law, Distributive Law, De Morgan's Law, and Absorption Law.

-I learned the different Rules of Inference. These are Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Hypothetical Syllogism, Disjunctive Syllogism, Addition, Simplification, Conjunction and Resolution.

#WEEK 3
I learned some methods of proof. These are the:

-Direct Proof

-Proof by Contraposition

-Vacuous Proof

-Trivial Proof

-Proof by Contradiction

-Proof by Equivalence

I also learned that 0 is even. :D


#WEEK 4
-I learned more about the Proof by Equivalence.

-I learned the proof by Mathematical Induction, which I remember from my ENGALG2 class.

#WEEK 5
-I learned about Program Correctness and the two steps involving it namely Partial Correctness - initial assertion - final assertion and showing that the program terminates correctly.
-I also learned the Program Algorithms. I had a hard time understanding this topic.
-I also learned some familiar topics like sets and the  venn diagram.

#WEEK 6
-I learned three types of functions. One-to-one, Onto, and Bijection.

#WEEK 7
-No Classes this week. How sad :((

#WEEK 8
-I learned about algorithms. I find it hard because I'm not good at programming.
-I also learned the pseudocodes. These topics are similar.
-We watched the dancing people so we can understand the Bubble Sort easily.

#WEEK 9
-I learned the two searching algorithms. These are the Linear search and the Binary search.
-I found the Binary search somewhat confusing.

#WEEK 10
-I learned the Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort and the Greedy Algorithm.
-Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort are used in sorting elements in a set. The Insertion is quite hard.

#WEEK 11
-I learned the Growth of functions.
-I learned the Big O - upper limit.
-I learned the Big Omega - lower limit.
-I learned the Big Theta - both upper and lower limit with different numerical coefficient.

#WEEK 12
-No Classes again. Sad week because no DISMATH. :((

#WEEK 13
-FINAL LECTURE WEEK!
-I learned the Handshaking Theorem.
-I learned the Euler Circuit.
-I learned the Euler Path.
-I learned the Hamilton Circuit.
-I learned the Hamilton Path.
